# KE_spectra

The horizontal kinetic energy (KE) spectra represent a valuable tool for NWP model validation. This repository archives the script to visualize the KE spectra at various vertical model levels as a function of the total horizontal wave number (K). The theoretical limits of K<sup>-5/3</sup> (characteristic of 3-D turbulence) and K<sup>-3</sup>(characteristic of 2-D turbulence) are displayed for comparison.
